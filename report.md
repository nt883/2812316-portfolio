In this lab, I learned how to create and manage a Git repository using Git and GitHub.I practiced adding,committing, and pushing files, as well as creating and merging branches.I also learned how to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure a webpage properly.This lab helped me understand how version control works and how it can improve my coding workflow.Finally, I deployed my portfolio to GitHub Pages, which made my webpage live online.
